## Project Description, Disclaimers, and Conclusions
This game was a simple personal project that I set out to do with the goal of learning how to use the Godot game engine to make games. The project turned out quite well, but the main take-away from this project is that I learned a LOT of new stuff. 

I've tried to tidy up the code in this finalised version and document it in-code as best I can, but I'm sure that I've missed some things. Also, since I came into this project as a beginner, I am 100% certain that I missed some very useful features of Godot that would have made things a lot simpler, but I'm still learning. 

I used plenty of tutorials on specific components of the project, but I did manage to complete this without using any "How to make Snake in Godot" tutorials. This meant that the project took longer, but I like to think that I have developed a deeper understanding of how the engine works by figuring a lot of it out by myself. 

I used GitHub's Project feature to plan and track my progress in this project. Currently those tickets are all private, but I may end up making them public for the sake of documentation (although it's likely that I won't since they're tickets on another repo. Whoops!).

Finally, I made all of the art for this by myself. It's nothing fancy at all, but I really quite enjoyed the process, so I'll hope to continue to develop this skill in future projects. 

To conclude, the game is playable and seems to work well enough, and I learned a whole lot.
